## ✨ Why this exists

aizzz.shop (ZZ 中转站) is a **New API** panel (`aizzz.shop`) with e-mail-code sign-up, password registration open, no captcha and OpenAI-compatible `https://aizzz.shop/v1` inference. The useful unit is *one account per key*, so this tool turns that into a `keys.txt` where **every line survived a real chat call** and a `tools` probe. Registration is closed to the public mailboxes this tool ships, so the fleet is whatever survives; the CLI still tries and prints the panel answer verbatim.

## 🎁 Free tier — how much you get

| What | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Sign-up credit | ~260 000 quota ≈ **$0.52** (`quota_per_unit` 500 000) |
| Daily check-in | **Yes** (`POST /api/user/checkin`, measured +11 632 in one call) |
| Card required | **No** |
| Captcha | **Off** (`turnstile_check=false`) |
| E-mail | code, **domain allow-list** (gmail.com / outlook.com are refused) |

No card, no captcha: a key costs one address the panel accepts.

> 💡 The free tier is set by aizzz.shop (ZZ 中转站) and can change. Check the live numbers at [aizzz.shop](https://aizzz.shop) — and let the tool's own gate decide:

```bash
node src/cli.js --verify-only     # every key in keys.txt is re-tested with a real chat call
```

## 🤖 Models — all undefined of them

The catalogue is served per token group. Verified live ids: `deepseek-v4-flash`, `deepseek-v4.1-flash`, `glm-5.2`. `deepseek-v4-flash` is the default of the CLI and the model used for every verification in this repo.

## 🧪 How to use the API

The base URL is **`https://aizzz.shop/v1`** — OpenAI-compatible, so anything that speaks OpenAI works.

```bash
curl https://aizzz.shop/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"deepseek-v4-flash","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"hi"}],"max_tokens":8}'
```

## 🛠 Quick start

```bash
# clone or fork this repository, then:
cd aizzz-bulk-apikey

# 1) your proxy list, one per line (http://… or socks5://…) — optional
printf 'http://127.0.0.1:8080\n' > proxies.txt

# 2) go
node src/launcher.js                 # interactive
# or directly:
node src/cli.js --count 10 --pool proxies.txt
node src/cli.js --revive --pool proxies.txt   # re-login stored accounts, check in, re-mint
node src/cli.js --verify                       # re-test every key in keys.txt
```

`keys.txt` is written **only** after a live chat completion proves the key.

### 🖱️ The launcher

The launcher asks for the proxy list, count and model, remembers them in `launcher.config.json`, and runs the CLI with the right flags.

## ✅ Verified working — every key is tested

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `https://aizzz.shop/v1/models` with the key | **200** — real catalogue |
| two live `POST /chat/completions` calls per key | **200**, non-empty content |
| `tools` — one `get_time` tool call, `tool_choice: auto` | **get_time tool_call returned** |
| this run (`preadd-gate.js --pool`, fail-closed exits) | **1 live / 37 keys tried** (34 dead) |
| a key that fails the chat check | never written to `keys.txt` |

> **Quality gates.** Every key here passed a live `chat-200` before it was written to `keys.txt`
> (dead keys are never shipped). Router combos follow the same rule at the model level: an entry is
> added **only if the model answers `chat-200` and can call tools** — a model without tool support,
> a dead key or a dead provider is dropped instead of added. Re-run the verify step any time;
> failures are reported, never hidden.

## 🧭 How it works

```
inbox (one address per account)                                  a fresh address per account
   │
   ├─▶ sign-up: aizzz.shop (ZZ 中转站) page → e-mail address → code / link from the inbox
   ├─▶ session: the account's cookies or access token in hand
   ├─▶ key mint: the account's key endpoint → plaintext key returned once (written to disk immediately)
   └─▶ live proof: POST https://aizzz.shop/v1/chat/completions → real content = the key is live
```

| Step | Call | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | `GET /api/verification?email=<addr>` | the panel answers the allow-list verdict verbatim |
| signup | `POST /api/user/register` | Turnstile is off; a 6-char code comes by mail |
| sign-in | `POST /api/user/login` | `data.access_token` (JWT) — this fork does **not** use a session cookie |
| credit | `POST /api/user/checkin` | daily, free |
| token | `POST /api/token/` with `{"group":"default"}` | a token outside a serving group answers 403 |
| key | `POST /api/token/<id>/key` | the list masks the key, the reveal endpoint does not |
| check | `POST /v1/chat/completions` and a `tools` call | live 200 + tool_call required before `keys.txt` |

## ⚙️ CLI options

```bash
node src/cli.js --count N            # mint N accounts (default 1)
node src/cli.js --revive             # re-login accounts.jsonl, check in, mint a fresh key
node src/cli.js --verify             # re-check every key in keys.txt
node src/cli.js --pool proxies.txt   # rotate exits, one exit per account
node src/cli.js --connect-9router    # register the provider on a local 9Router
node src/cli.js --help
```

| Environment variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AIZZZ_BASE` | `https://aizzz.shop` | panel base URL |
| `AIZZZ_PROXIES` | – | optional pool file, one exit per line |

## 🛰️ Behind a proxy

**Optional, recommended at scale** (per-IP rate limits and bans). Pass `--pool <file>` with one exit per line (`http://`, `https://` CONNECT or `socks5://`); every account uses the next exit, and a dead line fails only that attempt. Without a pool the tool connects directly.

## 📄 Files

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `keys.txt` | one live-verified key per line — git-ignored |
| `accounts.jsonl` | address / username / password / key / chat status per account |
| `proxies.txt` | your exits, one per line — git-ignored |

## 🔌 Connect to 9Router

[9Router](https://9router.com) is a self-hosted, OpenAI-compatible router. Register this provider once and every key becomes a connection under one provider-node:

```bash
node src/connect-9router.js
```

Defaults: `--base http://localhost:20128`, `--password 123456`, `--name "aizzz.shop (

## 🔌 Connect to OmniRoute

[OmniRoute](https://omniroute.online) is a self-hosted, OpenAI-compatible router. Register this provider once and every key becomes a connection under one provider-node:

```bash
node src/connect-omniroute.js
```

Defaults: `--base http://localhost:20128`, `--password 123456`, `--name "aizzz.shop (

ZZ 中转站)"`, `--prefix aizzz`, `--base-url https://aizzz.shop/v1`. Models are then served as `aizzz/<model id>` and load-balanced across every key.

## 🔑 What one key gets you

| | |
| --- | --- |
| 🏢 Provider | **aizzz.shop (ZZ 中转站)** — [aizzz.shop](https://aizzz.shop) |
| 🎁 What the provider gives | one account per key — every key answers a live chat call |
| 🔑 What one key gets you | one API key scoped to its own account: the full model ids on the endpoint below, at your plan's limits. The quota lives on the **account**, which is exactly why this tool creates one account per key |
| 🌐 API shape | OpenAI-compatible: `POST https://aizzz.shop/v1/chat/completions` |
| 🔒 Your data | only aizzz.shop and the inbox backend you configure are contacted; keys stay on your machine |

## 🐞 Issues

If the panel changes its signup shape, groups or credit, the tool stops at that step and prints the panel answer verbatim. **[Open an issue](../../issues)** with the command you ran and the exact output; PRs are welcome.
